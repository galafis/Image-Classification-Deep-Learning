# Image Classification with Deep Learning

This repository contains the code for an image classification project that utilizes deep learning techniques for accurate classification.

## Introduction

The project was developed using PyTorch, a widely adopted deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use.

The models were trained on a comprehensive dataset consisting of 100,000 images, and their performance was evaluated on an independent test set comprising 10,000 images.

## Achieved Accuracies

| Model           | Dataset         | Accuracy |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| AlexNet         | Natural Images  | 98%      |
| VGG             | Natural Images  | 98%      |
| Your CNN        | Natural Images  | 88%      |
| EfficientNet-B1 | Birds Species   | 95%      |
| EfficientNet-B4 | Birds Species   | 85%      |
| AlexNet         | Birds Species   | 94%      |
